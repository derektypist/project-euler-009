# Project Euler 009 - Special Pythagorean Triplet

A Pythagorean Triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.

For example, 3^2^ + 4^2^ = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2^

There exists exactly one Pythagorean Triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
The aim is to find the product a*b*c
